      "Answer: A neural network is a network of algorithms that is among the most powerful and complicated machine learning algorithms. It is not just one algorithm, but rather a combination of algorithms that parallel the neural connections in our mind. Neural networks involve mathematics that combines linear algebra and calculus, and they underlie many advanced algorithms, such as the model that runs ChatGPT.\n"

      "Answer:\n",
      " Perceptrons handle binary categories by using learned weights and inputs to calculate a summed value. This value determines whether the neuron activates (indicating one category) or fails to activate (indicating the other category). Essentially, a perceptron acts like an \"on and off\" switch, classifying inputs into two distinct categories, such as \"present\" or \"not present.\"\n",
